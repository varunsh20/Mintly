# Mintly

## Overview

- An NFT Marketplace on Mumbai network that allows Artists to convert their Digital Content like **Art, Music, Videos, Podcasts, Tickets** etc into Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT's) using **ERC-1155** token standard.
- The main focus of this project is to solve the problem of **middlemen and centalized authorities** taking **Shares** and cutting the **Incetives** of artists that registered on their platform for selling their content.
- Our platform connects both buyers and sellers at one place without any central authority taking profits in between. We charges 2% on the trading of a token as our **platform fees**.
- We allow our users to convert their content and sell them as ERC-1155 tokens. It provides every item a unique identity and metadata that sets them apart from one another.
  Though NFT's are unique but ERC-1155 provides the functionality of creating multiple copies of the same item. Since every transaction and information is recorded on blockchain, this provides the creators with a **Proof of Digital Ownership** over their content. Also users can **Buy and Sell** other artist's content as well at a reasonable price which ensures that the creators are getting rewarded for their work with no middlemen cutting their profits or sales.
